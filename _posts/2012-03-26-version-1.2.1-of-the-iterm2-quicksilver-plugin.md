title: Version 1.2.1 of the iTerm2 Quicksilver plugin

New release, no new features though. I only migrated to Scripting Bridge so the
plugin doesn't rely on an AppleScript to run commands in iTerm.

Should have been 1.2.0, but I forgot to lazy load the bridge, so 1.2.0 opened
iTerm when Quicksilver started.

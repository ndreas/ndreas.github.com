I have written a very simple plugin for [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) that
makes [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) available as a choice for Command Line
Interface.

Right now, the only commands the plugin supports are the "... in Terminal"
commands provided by Quicksilver's [Terminal
plugin](https://github.com/quicksilver/Terminal-qsplugin), but I have plans on
adding more functionality to the plugin.

The latest build of my plugin can be found in the download section of my GitHub
repo. There you can also find the (as of now) short documentation:

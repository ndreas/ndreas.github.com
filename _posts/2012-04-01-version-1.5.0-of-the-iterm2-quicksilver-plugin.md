In the new version of my plugin, I have added open in tab-alternatives to all
of the iTerm actions in the plugin:

The new actions are mutual alternatives, meaning that if you select `Open
Directory in iTerm` and press ⌘↩, it will open in a new tab, and if you use
`Open Directory in iTerm Tab` and press ⌘↩, it will open in a new terminal.

As you can see in the image, the tab variants are disabled by default. The
reason for this is I did not want to clutter the action list more than
necessary, and as stated above, the new actions are reachable by ⌘↩.

Should you want to open in tabs "by default", just disable the normal commands
and enable the tab commands. Or enable them both.

I have also added a tab variant for opening sessions:

I actually released a 1.4.0 version with just the session action, but just as I
had built and uploaded the release to GitHub, I realized that I might as well
add alternatives for all the other actions, so I didn't bother annoncing it.

I have no ideas for further development as of now, so this release is going to
stick for a while.

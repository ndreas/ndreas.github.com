A little bit of new functionalty - you can now right arrow into iTerm2 and open sessions:

The sessions can (as of now) be opened in a terminal window. I have plans to
add actions for opening in new tabs.

I also refactored my code a bit. Since this is my first Objective C project,
I'm still getting a feel for how to structure my code.

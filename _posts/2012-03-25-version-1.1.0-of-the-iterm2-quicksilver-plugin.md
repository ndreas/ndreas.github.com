I have added iTerm-specific commands to my iTerm2 Quicksilver plugin. The
commands supported are:

 * Run a Text Command in iTerm
 * Run in iTerm \[...\]
 * Open Parent Directory in iTerm
 * Open Directory in iTerm

These commands are straight copies of the corresponding commands of the
Terminal plugin, but instead of using the configured Command Line Interface,
they always use iTerm.

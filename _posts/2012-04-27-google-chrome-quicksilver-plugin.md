I have put together a plugin for accessing Chrome info and functionality in
Quicksilver. I have tried to match the features of the Safari plugin as far as
possible.

The 1.0.0 release of the plugin contains functionality for right arrowing into
Chrome, giving you access to the current open pages and the bookmarks:

The bookmark folders will have the same name as displayed in Chrome, that's why
the folders are in Swedish in my example.

In addition to this, both the current open pages and the bookmarks are
available in the catalog:

There are also two proxy objects, the current page:

<img src="/images/posts/2012-04-27/current-page.png" alt="Current page in Chrome">

and search the current site:

<img src="/images/posts/2012-04-27/current-site.png" alt="Search current site in Chrome">

The next feature to add is access to the Chrome history and I'll start working on it right away.
